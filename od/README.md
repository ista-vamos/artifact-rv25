# Experiments with Observational Determinism (OD)

```
. \
  - `ifm24`       Reproduce experiments with eHL from iFM'24 and compare them with the same experiments with sHL (int traces)
#- `ifm24-bits`  Reproduce experiments with eHL from iFM'24 and compare them with the same experiments with sHL (bitblasted traces)
  - `findata`     Run monitors on traces with finite integer data
#  - `vardata`     Run monitors on variable length input data
#  - `openssh`
